# Python Fundamentals: Assignments Repository

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains my solutions for introductory Python programming assignments. These projects demonstrate a foundational understanding of core Python concepts, including user input, data type conversion, string formatting, and basic arithmetic operations. They serve as a practical showcase of fundamental problem-solving in Python.

## ðŸš€ Projects Included

This collection features two main scripts, each designed to illustrate different basic programming principles:

### 1. Basic Mathematical Operations (`Perform Basic Mathematical Operations.py`)

This script functions as a simple command-line calculator, performing fundamental arithmetic operations on two numbers provided by the user.

* **Features:**
    * Accepts two numerical inputs (first number, second number) from the user.
    * Calculates the **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division** of these two numbers.
    * Prints all four results clearly to the console.
* **Concepts Demonstrated:**
    * User input with `input()`
    * Type casting (`str` to `int` and `float` for calculations)
    * Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
    * Formatted output with `print()`
* **Example Usage & Output:**
    ```
    first_number: 10
    second_number: 5
    multiplication: 50
    Subtraction: 5
    Addition: 15
    division: 2.0
    ```
    *(Based on the `Perform Basic Mathematical Operations.py` script)*

### 2. Personalized Greeting Generator (`Create a Personalized Greeting.py`)

This interactive script asks the user for their first and last name and then generates a custom, friendly welcome message.

* **Features:**
    * Prompts the user for their first name.
    * Prompts the user for their last name.
    * Combines the names into a custom greeting message.
    * Welcomes the user to the Python program.
* **Concepts Demonstrated:**
    * String variables
    * User input with `input()`
    * String concatenation (combining strings)
    * Printing customized output
* **Example Usage & Output:**
    ```
    first_name: Sumit
    last_name: Kumar
    Hello, Sumitkumar! Welcome to the python program.
    ```
    *(Based on the `Create a Personalized Greeting.py` script)*
